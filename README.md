# Writing tests in Jest for the freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges

I've decided to start learning how to test the JavaScript code, that I write, and the framework I chose is [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/).

Instead of coming up with some examples on my own, I've decided to use the functions that I wrote for the freeCodeCamp's [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/) and write the tests in Jest.

## How To Use It

```
git clone https://github.com/alexandracaulea/Intermediate-Algorithm-Scripting.git
cd Intermediate-Algorithm-Scripting
npm install
npm test
```

## Below you will find each challenge with a bit of description
